Every element of `runs` must be a plain object with: `workflow` a non-empty string, `conclusion` exactly the string 'success' or exactly 'failure' (any other value is invalid), and `mutation` a strict boolean. Extra fields on the record or on any run element are IGNORED — in particular a `tier` field on the record is a self-claim and is ignored, never rejected. A run is ADMISSIBLE if and only if its workflow is NOT exactly the string 'pages build and deployment' (case-sensitive, exact match; any other workflow name, including near-misses like 'Pages build and deployment', is admissible). Compute tier over admissible runs only: tier is 'Proven' if at least one admissible run has conclusion==='success' AND mutation===true; otherwise 'Works' if at least one admissible run has conclusion==='success'; otherwise 'Prototype'. evidence is the integer count of admissible runs with conclusion==='success', counted regardless of their mutation flag. Success shape: {ok:true, tier:'Proven'|'Works'|'Prototype', evidence:<integer>}. An empty runs array is valid and returns {ok:true, tier:'Prototype', evidence:0}.

  "description": "guardBooking(existing, candidate) decides whether a candidate booking clashes with existing bookings for the same unit. existing is an array (possibly empty) of booking objects {id, unit, checkin, checkout, status}; candidate is an object {unit, checkin, checkout}. Validation (any failure returns EXACTLY {ok:false} and nothing else): existing must be an array; every existing booking must have id and unit as non-empty strings, status exactly the string 'confirmed' or exactly 'cancelled', and checkin/checkout as valid ISO 'YYYY-MM-DD' strings (regex ^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$ AND a real Gregorian calendar date — 2026-02-30 is invalid; leap years honoured) with checkout strictly after checkin (lexicographic comparison of the ISO strings is sufficient); candidate must have unit as a non-empty string and checkin/checkout under the same date rules with checkout strictly after checkin. Semantics: a booking occupies the half-open night interval [checkin, checkout) — the checkout day itself is free, so an existing checkout equal to the candidate checkin is NOT a clash (back-to-back is allowed). An existing booking conflicts if and only if ALL of: its unit is exactly equal (===) to candidate.unit, its status is 'confirmed' (cancelled bookings never conflict), and the intervals overlap: existing.checkin < candidate.checkout AND candidate.checkin < existing.checkout (both strict lexicographic string comparisons). Overlap is a comparison of INTERVALS, never of start times: an existing booking fully containing, contained in, or partially overlapping the candidate all conflict. Success shape: {ok:true, clash:<boolean>, conflictIds:<array of the id strings of every conflicting existing booking, in the same order they appear in the existing array>}. clash is true if and only if conflictIds is non-empty.

The finite-integer check must stand on its own: NaN and non-integer numbers like 250.5 are invalid even though typeof reports 'number'; strings, null, and booleans are invalid. If scores is not an array, is empty (zero raters means nothing was assessed), or any element fails the check, return EXACTLY {ok:false} with no other fields. Otherwise return {ok:true, raters, spread} where raters = the number of elements. spread is null when raters is exactly 1 — one opinion is never agreement, and a lone scorecard must NEVER report spread 0. When raters >= 2, spread = max(scores) - min(scores), an integer >= 0 in hundredths.

Step 1 (calendar-month add with short-month clamp): the provisional due date is the same day-of-month, `months` calendar months after received; if the target month has no such day, clamp to the LAST day of the target month (31 Jan 2026 + 1 month = 28 Feb 2026; in a leap year it clamps to 29 Feb). Step 2 (working-day roll): while the provisional date is a Saturday, a Sunday, or exactly equal (string match) to any entry in holidays, advance it by exactly one calendar day; the roll may chain across consecutive weekends and holidays. Weekday determination is the standard Gregorian mapping of the ISO date. Success returns exactly {ok:true, due:'YYYY-MM-DD'} with the final zero-padded date.
